Curve-Tracer
===============
Generates the path of any curve fed as an equation.
The input may be in the form of a*x^n+b*y^n+a*x+b*y+c=0.
Circles, parabolas, hyperbolas, ellipses and other such curves are accepted.
For higher orders of x and y, the spacing between the points increases, hence the curve may not seem proper.
